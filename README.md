# CapacitiveMelody

CapacitiveMelody is an interactive project that uses Arduino, speakers, a buzzer, and a 'capacitive sensor' to create simple melodies. 
The capacitive sensor detects touch, triggering different musical notes and sequences, offering an engaging way to explore sound generation and sensor interaction with basic electronic components.

# Features

	•	Allows users to create interactive melodies.
	•	Demonstrates basic concepts of electronics,touch-based interaction.



# Prerequisites:
	•	Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
	•	Speaker or buzzer /resistor (330ohm)
	•	Capacitive touch sensor
	•	Jumper wires and a breadboard
	•	Arduino IDE installed on your computer
